# Introduction
--> Hello there! I want to introduce you to my new website project. I learned how to create it by following the instructions on The Odin Project website. The project mainly uses two important things: HTML (for structure) and CSS Flex (for making things look nice).

The Odin Project website has been a great teacher. It showed me step-by-step how to make websites. With the help of HTML and CSS Flex, I was able to make my website look good on different devices, like phones and computers.

Inside this place (the GitHub repository), you'll see all the hard work I put into making this website. I tried to make it both pretty and easy to use. It's a way for me to show how much I've learned about making websites. I used CSS Flex to arrange things neatly, no matter what screen you're looking at.
